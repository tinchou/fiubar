A registration profile model and associated manager.

The ``RegistrationProfile`` model and especially its custom manager
implement nearly all the logic needed to handle user registration and
account activation, so before implementing something in a view or
form, check here to see if they can take care of it for you.

Also, be sure to see the note on ``RegistrationProfile`` about use of the
``AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE`` setting.

		instances have the field ``is_active`` set to ``False``; any
		``User`` who is both inactive and has an expired activation
		key will be deleted.

		It is recommended that this method be executed regularly as
		part of your routine site maintenance; the file
		``bin/delete_expired_users.py`` in this application provides a
		standalone script, suitable for use as a cron job, which will
		call this method.

		Regularly clearing out accounts which have never been
		activated serves two useful purposes:

		1. It alleviates the ocasional need to reset a
		   ``RegistrationProfile`` and/or re-send an activation email
		   when a user does not receive or does not act upon the
		   initial activation email; since the account will be
		   deleted, the user will be able to simply re-register and
		   receive a new activation key.

		2. It prevents the possibility of a malicious user registering
		   one or more accounts and never activating them (thus
		   denying the use of those usernames to anyone else); since
		   those accounts will be deleted, the usernames will become
		   available for use again.

		If you have a troublesome ``User`` and wish to disable their
		account while keeping it in the database, simply delete the
		associated ``RegistrationProfile``; an inactive ``User`` which
		does not have an associated ``RegistrationProfile`` will not
		be deleted.
